The dream company which I finally joined at 25 years old.
Luck doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from 5 years back. That luck started in 2004 &amp;ndash; 15 years ago when I was 15 years old. I started to go to Technical High School. This luck led me to receive an offer to start my first internship for 2 or 3 months at the Data Processing Laboratory of Colégio Bagozzi, right after starting my technical course.</description></item></channel></rss>
